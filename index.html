                                <dd>TSustainable fiber manufacturer Hyosung TNC is partnering with Ambercycle, an
                                    innovator of textile-to-textile circular polyester material, to advance the
                                    commercialization of this decarbonized material innovation. Seoul, South Korea, and
                                    Los Angeles, California, June 12, 2024 — Hyosung TNC, one of the world’s leading
                                    sustainable textile solutions providers, has partnered with Ambercycle, a leading
                                    material science company, to become the first manufacturer in South Korea to
                                    introduce a textile-to-textile, circular polyester into supply chains. The
                                    collaboration advances the partners’ shared vision of a circular textile ecosystem
                                    that repurposes end-of-life products into high-performing fibers for brands looking
                                    to curb their environmental impact. The partnership will tap Hyosung’s 58 years of
                                    advanced fiber manufacturing capabilities and nearly two decades of experience
                                    producing high-quality, sustainable textiles to support the integration of
                                    Ambercycle’s circular polyester material, cycora®, into brand supply chains. “Our
                                    collaboration with Ambercycle is another important step we are taking to help our
                                    customers meet their sustainability goals and scale solutions that both present and
                                    future generations can enjoy,” said Chi Hyung Kim, CEO, Hyosung TNC. “We’re
                                    impressed with cycora® for its quality but also for its potential to divert tons of
                                    textile waste from landfills and incinerators and reduce the extraction of raw
                                    materials used in the production of virgin polyester.” Based in Los Angeles,
                                    Ambercycle is rapidly scaling cycora®, a regenerated polyester chip that meets the
                                    spinnability standards of virgin materials and outperforms other recycled materials,
                                    according to testing by the European Center for Innovative Textiles (CETI), a
                                    leading research institute. Ambercycle’s trailblazing molecular regeneration
                                    technology will add to a growing portfolio of circular solutions manufactured by
                                    Hyosung TNC, the company behind regen™, a global premier recycled fiber brand.
                                    Developed at its research and development center, Hyosung was the world’s first
                                    company to develop regen™ nylon from discarded fishing nets in 2007 and achieved
                                    another significant milestone by becoming the first company to globally receive the
                                    Global Recycled Standard (GRS) certification for its recycled regen™ polyester. The
                                    company was also the first to introduce RCS-certified 100% recycled regen™ spandex
                                    in 2020, and USDA, SGS-certified bio-based spandex made from partly renewable
                                    resources in 2021. “The fashion industry is searching for accessible, high-quality
                                    circular solutions. This partnership is a testament to that demand and an important
                                    step to ramp up the production of cycora® and make it easier for brands to source
                                    regenerated materials for their fashion lines. We’re closely aligned with Hyosung on
                                    both our high-quality standards and our commitment to circularity, so we are
                                    thrilled to have them as a partner in our commercialization journey,” says Shay
                                    Sethi, CEO of Ambercycle. About Ambercycle Ambercycle is powering circularity in

                                    materials, Ambercycle is minimizing the impact of raw material extraction on our
